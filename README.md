### Features to Add by Fixer112
- [x] ~~Added a "FrontPage" sort order option for discussions marked as "FrontPage"~~
- [ ] Add an option to add FrontPage as the default sort order on the index page.

### Features to Add by Friends of Flarum
- [x] ~~Add "Push to FrontPage" and "Pull from FrontPage" discussion controls to IndexPage instead of post controls (should behave like the Sticky extension).~~
- [ ] Refactor to add redraw() functionality to dynamically update the DOM after the push/pulls 
buttons are clicked on so no page refresh will be needed.
